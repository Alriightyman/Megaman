# Megaman ##

## Description (WIP)
This project was originally based off [ellioman's Megaman 2 Airman Stage recreation](https://github.com/ellioman/Megaman). Very outdated, it's been updated to a more current version of Unity.  Prefabs have been updated to take advantage of new features that were not present in earlier versions of Unity. The project has been turned into a Megaman type engine designed to create a Megaman clone type game instead of a recreation. Sprites will be updated later to reflect that.

#### Original Description
This project was done in 2013 after graduating from Danmarks Tekniske Universitet. Decided to use time while unemployed to learn about Unity3D and what better way to learn than by recreating a part of one of your favorite games? 

Megaman 2 is a classic platform game by Capcom which was released in 1988. This is without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time and countless hours of my childhood were spent on destroying robots made by the evil Dr.Wily.

I decided to recreate the airman stage from Megaman 2. The game was initially created on Unity3D 4.0 using C# but has been updated to use Unity 5.2.2. The graphics used in this game were found on various sprite websites. 


## New Features
- More accurate movement.  Jumping feels closer to the original games. Not perfect yet, but better than before. 
- 2D sprites.  The original used 3D Objects and materials. This has been updated to use 2D renderers and collision. 
- New 2D Character Controller. 
- Animations.  Now uses animations instead of calculating which material to use based on current object actions. 
- Updated UI. UI is now using the more updated Unity UI.
- Power ups.  Power ups, such as health, are not present. 
- Enemy object behave like the originals should. (Airman demo)

## Requirements ##
The project uses Unity 2019.2.1f.
